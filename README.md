# Spontaneous
Code for "Spontaneous activity competes with externally evoked responses in sensory cortex", accepted for publication in PNAS and archived at https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.18.256206v2.
The matlab code in Karvat_et_al_2021_script_1.m shows the calculations performed to obtain figure 2, with accompanying raw data from one session.
Other m. files are accessory functions which should be added to the path.
For power calculations, we use the fieldtrip toolbox, which has to be added to the path as well. This free tooblox can be downloaded from https://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/.
